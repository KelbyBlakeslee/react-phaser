# react-phaser

A Phaser implementation done in React. It's in experimental phase, and the API
is likely to go through large changes.

The `src/examples` folder contains the React-based code illustrating how
to implement different parts of the
[Phaser.io Making your first game tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game).

Under `examples` you can find ready-to-run html pages corresponding to
the examples. As required by Phaser, on order to run these pages in a
browser you need to serve them from a web server.

- `part5`: demonstrates loading assets, creating sprites and groups, and
defining colliding actors.
- `part6`: demonstrate keyboard input.
- `part7`: demonstrate modifying the VDOM (removing sprite) during the game.
